# Domain Research

Domain Overview: Climate & Data Science

Climate systems are complex and affect nearly every aspect of life—from public health and agriculture to energy use and environmental quality. Scientists and policymakers rely increasingly on data to monitor climate conditions, forecast changes, and make informed decisions. In our project, we focus on how historical and near-real-time environmental data can help assess trends, risks, and vulnerabilities.

Data science allows us to analyze and interpret large sets of environmental data such as:
 • temperature and rainfall time series
 • satellite imagery
 • air quality indices
 • land and crop classifications
 • energy use patterns

By combining climate knowledge with data skills, we hope to contribute insights relevant to climate adaptation, resource planning, and public health.

Focus Areas and Relevance

We are exploring three specific research directions,
 each rooted in real-world needs and supported by available data.

1. Water-Intensive vs. Drought-Tolerant Crops
 • ❓ Research Question: How has the share of water-intensive versus
 drought-tolerant crops changed (2000–2024) in an irrigation-dependent
 river basin experiencing rainfall variability?
 • 📌 Relevance: Agriculture consumes a major part of freshwater.
 Understanding shifts in crop choices can reveal how farmers adapt to
 changing water availability.
 • 📊 Common Data Types:
 • Crop type maps (remote sensing, agricultural surveys)
 • Irrigation zones
 • Seasonal precipitation records

1. Urban Heat Waves
 • ❓ Research Question: How have the duration and intensity of summertime heat
  waves changed (1990–2024) in rapidly urbanizing cities?
 • 📌 Relevance: Extreme heat events are becoming more common due to climate
  change and urban expansion. This has consequences for health systems and infrastructure.
 • 📊 Common Data Types:
 • Daily maximum temperature records
 • Urban growth indicators (e.g., land use, population density)
 • Health/emergency response data (if available)

1. Air Quality Forecasting & PM₂.₅
 • ❓ Research Question: How has the accuracy of forecasting next-day PM₂.₅
  levels evolved between 2010 and 2024 in highly industrialized urban areas?
 • 📌 Relevance: PM₂.₅ pollution is harmful to human health. Forecasting
  accuracy affects warning systems and medical preparedness.
 • 📊 Common Data Types:
 • Hourly/daily PM₂.₅ concentrations
 • Meteorological data (wind, temperature, humidity)
 • Historical forecast records (from government or academic sources)
