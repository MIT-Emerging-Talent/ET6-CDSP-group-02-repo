# Project Overview: Climate Change & Urban Heatwaves

This project examines how climate change is increasing the frequency and
severity of urban heatwaves, especially in fast-growing cities in North Africa,
Southeast Asia, and the Middle East. The urban heat island effect amplifies
these risks, threatening public health, energy systems, and vulnerable
communities.

## Research Question

How have the duration and peak intensity of summertime heat waves changed from
1990 to 2024 in rapidly urbanizing metropolitan areas, and what does this mean
for public-health officials, energy utilities, and at-risk residents?

## Key Points

- **Stakeholders:** Public-health officials, energy utilities, urban planners,  
  and vulnerable residents.

- **Systems Thinking:** Rising urban temperatures drive higher cooling demand,  
  increasing energy use and potentially worsening warming if energy is not  
  sustainable.

- **Data:** Analysis uses NASA MODIS and NOAA GHCN datasets, guided by IPCC and
  peer-reviewed literature.
