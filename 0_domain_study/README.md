## Climate Data Science Project -- MileStone 1

## Problem Statement

In both rural and urban parts of Nigeria, I have personally experienced the
struggle of accessing reliable and affordable electricity. In my father's
community, residents have paid repeatedly for electricity repairs, yet there
is still no power supply. As a result, many have switched to renewable energy
sources like solar. In Lagos, where I live, electricity bills are rising even
though my household uses very few appliances.
These challenges are worsened during hot seasons when cooling needs increase.
As cities rapidly urbanize, heat waves are becoming more intense and frequent —
placing pressure on already fragile energy systems, and putting vulnerable
populations at greater risk. This context motivated our group to explore how
heat waves are evolving and what this means for public services and residents.

## Research Question

**How have the duration and peak intensity of summertime heat waves (X) changed
over the 1990 – 2024 period (Y) in rapidly urbanising metropolitan areas (Z),
and what does that imply for public-health officials, energy utilities, and
heat-vulnerable residents?**

## Domain Overview

- **Climate change** is leading to more frequent and severe heat waves worldwide.
- **Urban areas** like Lagos experience even higher temperatures due to the urban
  heat island effect.
- These changes strain **public health systems**, **electricity supply**, and
  **residents' ability to stay safe and cool**.
- The project explores how historical temperature data and urban development
  trends can reveal useful patterns for climate adaptation.

## Stakeholders

- **Public health officials** (e.g., city hospitals, emergency responders)
- **Energy utilities** (e.g., electricity providers)
- **Urban planners**  (e.g., local government planning authorities responsible
  for zoning, green spaces, and infrastructure)
- **Heat-vulnerable residents** (e.g., elderly, low-income communities)

## Data Science Opportunity

- Analyze temperature data from 1990–2024.
- Track changes in heat wave duration and intensity.
- Identify which urban areas are most at risk.
- Recommend actions for stakeholders to protect vulnerable populations.
