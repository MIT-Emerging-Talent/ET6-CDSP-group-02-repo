Domain Overview: Climate & Data Science

This folder contains our team’s research notes, resources, and summaries related
 to our domain: climate and its impacts on human systems. Our work focuses on
  understanding the effects of climate variability on agriculture, urban
   heatwaves, and air pollution patterns. The resources here support our efforts
    to frame meaningful, data-informed research questions.

🧭 Domain Overview

Climate change is no longer a distant threat — it is a present challenge,
 reshaping how cities grow, how farmers plant, and how people breathe.
  Variability in rainfall, rising temperatures, and deteriorating air quality
   are affecting agriculture, infrastructure, and public health across the globe.

Our project explores three specific challenges in this space:
 • Shifts in crop choices (water-intensive vs. drought-tolerant)
  in water-stressed river basins
 • Changes in the intensity and duration of summertime heatwaves in
  fast-growing urban centers
 • The evolving predictability of fine-particulate pollution (PM₂.₅)
  in heavily industrialized cities

❓ Our Research Questions & Context

We identified the following research questions and began exploring
 relevant literature, data types, and concepts.

1. Crop Adaptation in Water-Stressed Basins

“How has the share of water-intensive versus drought-tolerant crops changed over
 the 2000–2024 period in an irrigation-dependent river basin experiencing
  fluctuating growing-season rainfall?”
 • Crop adaptation is a key strategy in regions facing increased water scarcity.
  Some studies show trends toward drought-resilient crops, but clear
   longitudinal data is lacking in many regions.
 • We found that global datasets (e.g., FAOSTAT), national agriculture surveys,
  and satellite-derived land use data (e.g., from Google Earth Engine) are
   commonly used for this kind of analysis.

2- Urban Heatwave Dynamics

“How have the duration and peak intensity of summertime heat waves changed
 the 1990–2024 period in rapidly urbanizing metropolitan areas?”
 • Urban heat islands intensify temperature spikes, especially during summer
  months. Understanding long-term trends is crucial for city planners
   and health agencies.
 • We’re exploring temperature datasets (e.g., NASA MODIS, NOAA GHCN),
  as well as regional case studies from cities in North Africa, Southeast
   Asia, and the Middle East.

3- PM₂.₅ Predictability in Polluted Cities

“How has the accuracy of forecasting next-day PM₂.₅ levels from the previous
 day’s air-quality history evolved between 2010 and 2024 in heavily
  industrialized, pollution-prone metropolitan areas?”
 • Forecasting PM₂.₅ is vital for public health alerts. Machine
  learning models and time-series analysis are increasingly used, though
   forecasting performance varies greatly by location and season.
 • We’re reviewing datasets from OpenAQ, World Air Quality Index (WAQI),
  and regional monitoring agencies.

🔍 Next Steps
 • Finalize a regional focus (e.g., specific river basins or cities) for each question
 • Identify and test open datasets for availability and usability
 • Clarify technical concepts
  (e.g., drought indices, urban heat island effect, AQI forecasting methods)
 • Continue building literature summaries and potential methods for milestone 2
