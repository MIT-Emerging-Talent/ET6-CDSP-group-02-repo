# Climate Change and Urban Heatwaves

## ðŸ”Œ Problem Statement

One of our team members described how residents in both rural and urban Nigerian
communities struggle with accessing reliable and affordable electricity. In his
fatherâ€™s rural village, power outages are frequentâ€”even after people continue
paying for repairs. In cities like Lagos, people try to cut back on appliance
use, yet electricity bills still increase, especially during heat waves. This
reveals a deeper issue: a mismatch between energy infrastructure, pricing
systems, and climate pressures. As a result, residentsâ€”especially those most
vulnerableâ€”are pushed toward costly or unstable energy alternatives, exposing
a growing gap between public services and real community needs.

## 1. Introduction

Our groupâ€™s project investigates the intersection of climate change and urban
heatwaves, focusing on how rising temperatures and extreme heat events are
impacting rapidly urbanizing cities, especially in regions such as North Africa,
Southeast Asia, and the Middle East. We apply a systems thinking approach to
understand the complex feedback loops and interdependencies that define this
problem domain.

## 2. Background and Relevance

Climate change has led to an increase in the frequency, duration, and severity
of heatwaves worldwide, with urban areas facing heightened risks due to the
urban heat island (UHI) effect. The UHI effect occurs when buildings, roads,
and dense infrastructure absorb and re-emit heat, raising local temperatures
above those in surrounding rural areas. As cities expand, infrastructure often
lags behind population growth, leaving vulnerable populationsâ€”such as the
elderly, children, outdoor workers, and low-income familiesâ€”at greater risk
from extreme heat events.

## 3. Research Question and Scope

**Central Research Question:**  
How have the duration and peak intensity of summertime heat waves changed from
1990 to 2024 in rapidly urbanizing metropolitan areas, and what are the
implications for public-health officials, energy utilities, and heat-vulnerable
residents?

- **What:** Duration (number of days) and peak intensity (maximum temperature)  
  of heatwaves  
- **When:** 1990â€“2024  
- **Where:** Rapidly urbanizing metropolitan areas in North Africa,  
  Southeast Asia, and the Middle East

## 4. Stakeholder Identification

- **Public-health officials:** Design emergency response plans, issue heat  
  advisories, and protect at-risk communities.  
- **Energy utilities:** Manage electricity demand for cooling and ensure grid  
  stability during heatwaves.  
- **Urban planners and policymakers:** Develop adaptation strategies like green
  infrastructure, update building codes, and create public cooling centers.  
- **Vulnerable residents:** Elderly, children, those with health conditions,  
  outdoor workers, and low-income families at high risk from heatwaves.

## 5. Systems Thinking Perspective

We approach the problem as a dynamic system with interconnected components and
feedback loops.

- **System Components:** Climate patterns, urban infrastructure, energy grids,  
  public health services, demographics, and socioeconomic factors.  
- **Feedback Loops:** Rising urban temperatures increase demand for cooling,  
  driving energy consumption. If the energy is sourced from fossil fuels, this  
  further intensifies greenhouse gas emissions and local warming.  
- **Leverage Points:** Interventions such as green infrastructure,  
  energy-efficient cooling, and community support networks can significantly  
  boost system resilience.

## 6. Data and Evidence Foundations

Our analysis is grounded in empirical data and authoritative literature.

- **Datasets:** NASA MODIS Land Surface Temperature and NOAA GHCN provide  
  high-resolution, long-term data on temperature trends and heatwave events.  
- **Key Metrics:** Number of heatwave days, maximum temperatures, and  
  cumulative heat exposure.  
- **Literature:** The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report and peer-reviewed studies on
  UHI effects and urban adaptation guide our framework.

## 7. Heatwave Definitions

Heatwaves are typically defined as periods of anomalously high temperatures
relative to local norms. These are often operationalized as temperatures above
the 90th percentile for at least three consecutive days. Local context and
climate variability are critical in determining appropriate thresholds for
analysis.

## 8. Impacts and Leverage Points

- **Public Health:** Each 1Â°C rise in temperature is associated with increased  
  mortality and morbidity, particularly among vulnerable urban populations.  
- **Energy Systems:** Heatwaves drive spikes in electricity demand, risking grid
  overload and blackouts, especially where infrastructure is insufficient.  
- **Adaptation Strategies:** Effective interventions include green  
  infrastructure, early warning systems, and policies for vulnerable  
  communities.

## 9. Group Insights and Next Steps

- **Insights:** Urban heatwaves are increasing in both frequency and intensity,
  with the most severe impacts on vulnerable groups in fast-growing cities.  
- **Knowledge Gaps:** More research is needed to standardize heatwave  
  definitions and evaluate adaptation strategies' effectiveness.  
- **Next Steps:** Finalize city selection, create a consistent method for  
  identifying and measuring heatwaves, and continue literature review and data  
  collection for the next milestone.
