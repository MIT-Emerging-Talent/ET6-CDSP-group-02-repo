# Milestone 1 : Retrospective

## Overview

This retrospective evaluates the **Problem Identification** phase of our
Data Science project. We analyzed the impact of summertime heat waves on
urban areas and developed an actionable research question.

## What Went Well

- Highlight the positive aspects of the project.
- Discuss effective strategies and tools.

## Continue Doing

- Sharing responsibilities and collaborating effectively on the repository.
- Respectfully communicating and engaging all team members.
- Following prepared guides for workflows and assigning reviewers evenly.
- Ensuring meetings remain engaging and productive.
- Delivering quality results while fostering a learning and growth environment.

## What Could Be Improved

- Identify challenges faced during the project.
- Suggest areas for improvement.
- Be more engaged in the slack chanel

## Stop Doing

- Not creating tasks on the board at the beginning of the project.
- Failing to have all team members in discussions.
- Neglecting to make notes of every meeting.
- Wait for the last day to submit our assignments.

## Start Doing

- Create a project board to track our progress more efficiently.
- Keeping track of changes that affect the overall group.
- Planning the project during the early stages for better alignment.

## Lessons Learned

- Effective collaboration and respect among team members significantly improve
project outcomes.
- A lack of structured planning and incomplete documentation can lead to
  inefficiencies.
- Including all team members in discussions ensures diverse perspectives and avoids
misunderstandings.
- Early and clear communication about roles, goals, and expectations sets the
stage for a smoother workflow.

## Next steps

- Gather climate datasets covering the specified timeframe.
- Identify key indicators for heat wave duration and intensity.
