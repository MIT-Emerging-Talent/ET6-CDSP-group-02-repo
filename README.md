# 🌿 Team GreenFrontier

Welcome to the collaborative space of **Team GreenFrontier** – Group 02
of the MIT Emerging Talent CDSP program.

We are a team of aspiring data scientists passionate about using data for social
impact. Our current project explores the **intersection of climate change,
heatwaves, and energy access in urban areas**—with a focus on real-world
challenges in regions like Nigeria, North Africa, and Southeast Asia.

## 🔌 Problem Statement

One of our team members described how residents in both rural and urban Nigerian
communities struggle with accessing reliable and affordable electricity. In his
father’s rural village, power outages are frequent—even after people continue
paying for repairs. In cities like Lagos, people try to cut back on appliance
use, yet electricity bills still increase, especially during heat waves. This
reveals a deeper issue: a mismatch between energy infrastructure, pricing
systems, and climate pressures. As a result, residents—especially those most
vulnerable—are pushed toward costly or unstable energy alternatives, exposing a
growing gap between public services and real community needs.

## 🌎 Project Domain

Our project falls under the **climate and urban heatwaves** domain. We explore:

- How rising temperatures and more frequent heatwaves affect city life
- How energy systems respond to climate stress
- Who is most impacted, and where the systems are failing

We take a systems-thinking approach to understand how climate, energy, public
health, and urban infrastructure interact in rapidly urbanizing regions.

## ❓ Research Question

> **How have the duration and peak intensity of summertime heat waves changed
from 1990 to 2024 in rapidly urbanizing metropolitan areas, and what are the
implications for public-health officials, energy utilities, and heat-vulnerable residents?**
