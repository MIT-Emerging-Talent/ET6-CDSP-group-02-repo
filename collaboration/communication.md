## Asking for Help

There’s a fine line between confidently learning from your mistakes and
stubbornly getting nowhere. Here’s a general guide for when to ask for help
based on how long you’ve been stuck:

1. 0–30 min: Try on your own  
2. 30–60 min: Ask your group for help  
3. 60+ min: Tag your coaches on Slack or GitHub
