# Constraints

Some boundaries around our project.

## External

<!--
  constraints coming from the outside that your team has no control over:
  - project deadlines
  - number of unit tests required to pass a code review
  - technologies (sometimes a client will tell you what to use)
  - power or connectivity
  - ...
-->

## Internal: Involuntary

<!--
  constraints that come from within your team, and you have no control over:
  - each of your individual skill levels
  - amount of time available to work on the project
-->

## Internal: Voluntary

<!--
  constraints that your team decided on to help scope the project. they may include:
  - coding style & conventions
  - agree on a code review checklist for the project repository
  - the number of hours you want to spend working
  - only using the colors black and white
-->

## External_

- Our project must be completed by the final submission deadline provided by
  MIT Emerging Talent.
- Some team members have limited experience using GitHub, which may slow down
  collaboration and version control at the beginning of the project.
- We are expected to follow the markdown formatting and project structure
  guidelines already provided in the template.
- Internet connectivity is sometimes inconsistent for team members in different
  locations, so all tools used must be lightweight and offline-friendly where possible.

## Internal: Involuntary_

- Some team members do not have access to data and good internet connectivity.
- We’re in different time zones, so we’ll rely on asynchronous (async) communication
  such as slack and sometimes live meetings when crucial.

## Internal: Voluntary_

- We will write clean, well-commented code and follow PEP8 (Python style guide).
- We’ll use pull requests for all contributions and ensure at least one team
    member reviews any major changes before merging.
-We’ve agreed to not focus on anything not related to climate.
- We'll use only black-and-white charts unless a color palette is
  approved by the group.
